# hands-up-for-judo
Learn names of the judo techniques by raising your hands in front of your webcam.

The game is available at:

The body pose estimation does not really work well when you are sitting in front of the computer.
Make sure you stand up at some distance from the camera.

The images of the techniques were taken from: https://wikipedia.org.

The icon images were taken from: https://thenounproject.com/.
We took only the icons which were strictly marked as "free".
